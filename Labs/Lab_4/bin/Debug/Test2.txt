Full of despair
Inside a darkness
Self-conscious and scared
Held prisoner of war

Running out of air
Buried in the sadness
Want a way out
Of this paralyzing world

And the sound of the cries
When a families loved one dies
It echoes throught a vacant room
Where a young soul still resides

When the night is cold
And you feel like no one knows
What it's like to be the only one
Buried in this hole

You can make it to the sunrise
You can make it to the sunrise

Searching for a way
To escape the madness
A dire need for change
As we fight for better days

The hurt and the pain
Cut deep like a razor blade
Holding in a cry for love
Abandoned and afraid

When the night is cold
And you feel like no one knows
What it's like to be the only one
Buried in this hole

You can make it to the sunrise
You can make it to the sunrise

I won't go to my grave
Until a difference is made
